LeapMaze
========

A simple 3d maze game using the leap motion

Using Python 2.7.6
Must have pygame, pyopengl, and Leap Motion Controller software installed

You can download Pygame from http://www.pygame.org/
You can download PyOpenGL from http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/

The code in here is designed for a computer with screen resolution 1280 x 800 running Mac OSX.
To run locally, change LeapMaze.py line 11 to use your screen resolution, and make sure you have the proper Leap Motion Controller libraries in your folder. (Note: You might have to replace the ones that I have)
